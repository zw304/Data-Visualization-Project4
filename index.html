Note: the data can be accessed with GU credentials. The revised data set is named as data_munging.csv which is obtained in this repository. The data_munging.csv contains 8 variables as: Date, mean of Power usage/day for Lamp, Laptop & Printer, Router & Sheeva Plug Computer, Coffee, Entertainment (TV & Stereo), Fridge, and Kettle. </h2>

  <h2 class="w3-center">Story Telling</h2><br>
  <p class="w3-medium"><span class="w3-tag w3-light-grey"> Storyline: </span>  One household in swiss is curious about its electricity and power usage. Provided with the information about particular plugs/appliances per second over a period of time, the household therefore wants data scientist to do visualizations for them based on the following questions:  </p>
  <p>1.	Among working/studying usage (Lamp, Laptop & Printer, Router & Sheeva Plug Computer), daily common usage (Router & Sheeva Plug Computer, Coffee, Fridge, and Kettle), and Entertainment usage (TV & Stereo), which category has the most power consumption?</p>
  
 <p>2.	In which season have the most power consumption? </p>
 <p>3.	What is the trend of usage categories in these 8 months? </p>

   <h2>Plotly Plot in R:</h2>

   <p class="w3-medium"><span class="w3-tag w3-light-grey"> Related Question: </span> Among working/studying usage (Lamp, Laptop & Printer, Router & Sheeva Plug Computer), daily common usage (Router & Sheeva Plug Computer, Coffee, Fridge, and Kettle), and Entertainment usage (TV & Stereo), which category has the most power consumption? </p>
   <p class="w3-medium"><span class="w3-tag w3-light-grey"> Write Up: </span>  Using R as the programming language to do this visualization in plotly package, I decide to use facet histograms to visualize the power usage. There are many visualization types such as line graph, and scatter plot to choose, the histogram is the best option. Although the line graph can clearly show the usage trend, the 1st question is not focusing on the usage fluctuaction but on the total usage amount of each category. For scatter plot, it can show the maximum and minimum value of usage amount but the plot would be very messy when combining subcategories into one. Therefore, after comparison, the histogram plot would be the most suitable one which can clearly show the total usage for this household. After deciding the plot to use, I then consider the way for household to make an easy comparison. Then, I choose to use facet plots and merge these 7 variables into 3 main categories: working usage, entertainment usage, and daily common usage. This can perfectly answer the question that for household 6, the range of working usage is the greatest. It seems that the power coverage of Lamp and Laptop can be very high which can be over 100 per day, but also very low which is nearly 0. The entertainment usage is more normal and cost higher when around 20 Watts. Among the category of Daily common usage, Kettle and Coffee have the higher power coverage while the usage of Fridge is lower. </p>

  <h2>Altair Plot in Python:</h2>
 
  <div class="w3-center">
   <iframe src="altair.html" width="100%" height="800"></iframe>
   </div>

  <p class="w3-medium"><span class="w3-tag w3-light-grey"> Related Question: </span> <a> In which season have the most power consumption?</a> <a>What is the trend of usage categories in these 8 months? </a></p>

<p class="w3-medium"><span class="w3-tag w3-light-grey"> Write Up: </span>  This is an interactive Altair plot generated by using Python. It contains 7 subplots in different colors with the same vertical and horizontal label. This plot is created for answering the last 2 questions that the household would like to know: “In which season have the most power consumption?”  And “What is the trend of usage categories in these 8 months?”. The rationale of creating this graph is based on these 2 questions. Since the questions are related with season, power consumption, and subcategories, I decide to set the x-axis as “date” and y-axis as “Power Usage in 10 Watts”. Different like the former Plotly plot that aims to get the total frequency amount, the goal of creating this Altair plot is to get the overall trend of each variables and provide insight to the household that in which specific month and category it needs to control the power usage and therefore save more money. After thinking of these logically, I then decide to use line plot with 7 subplots. In the records of these 8 months, we found that the power usage of Entertainment is the highest in this household which can reach 500 Watts from July to November. It seems that the power usage of Coffee and Kettle have very similar pattern which can have some potential relationship. These two categories both reach very frequent fluctuations around October. Combining the performance of all categories, the cost in 2012 October would be the highest in 8 months. Among these, Router and Sheeva Plug Computer have the most stable and stationary trend around 20 Watts which makes sense that a household need to use Router every day. Seems the household owners are rarely at home in July since there is a dramatic decrease for Routers and Lamp, and Entertainment. </p>
